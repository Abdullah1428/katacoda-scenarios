For this tutorial we have successfully deployed and invoked our Serverless application and that was our main
goal from this session.

In this last step, we will just see the output from our CloudFormation service on AWS to see what happens when we run the `sls deploy` command.

Login to your AWS management console and search for CloudFormation and open it. In CloudFormation click on stacks.

Here is a screenshot from the CloudFormation and it should look similar for you.
